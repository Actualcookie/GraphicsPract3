--Work--
Lars implemented the spotlight, greyscale and the camera rotation, tim implemented multiple light sources and cell shading



--Implemented assignments--

Cell shading


Multiple Light Sources


Color filter
The color filter has been implemented 

Spotlight
The spotlight is implemented as a point light that only affect vertices within a certain cone of a direction given to it.
We were unable to properly implement a quad, so correctly showing that it works is difficult.
